# **My First Astro Blog**
I know this Blog post is not much, but it is genuinely shocking as to how easy it was to set this up using Astro. For those wondering **[Astro](https://astro.build)** is a content driven web framework that makes setting up blog sites, documentation sites and whatnot, a total breeze. It keeps it simple, while also not losing out on any sort of functionality as we have the ability to write whatever custom js that we want. 

So yeah. I guess this would be my first ever blog post. Oh as I am writing this, it is Deepavali today. Idk I thought I would mention that. 

Anyways, here's to hopefully many more blog posts. Cheers!
