## **Introvert**
I am what you would consider an introvert. It's not that I don't want to converse and interact with people. In fact, once I get to know people, I am definitely the most chatty one. But I have a certain anxiety or discomfort initiating conversations and starting an interaction, especially with new people. I think this stems from an inate worry of others judging me for being slightly weird. As I write this, I am reminded of Richard Feynman and "What do you care what other people think?". But I think it's impossible (or at the very least, really difficult) for a human to completely not care about being judged by fellow humans. I certainly cannot do that, not at the moment anyways. Maybe this is the reason I have never done a vlog, though I find the art of vlogging your life very interesting. Anyways, I digress. I have been noticing though, that there are a lot more people like me, and in fact, many of you might relate with me. By the end of this piece, I want to see if there is a greater cause for this and if this is a larger, societal trend, or if I am just a crazy guy trying to attribute causes to his own intrinsic abilities or lack thereof.

## **Social aspect of the human species**
Humans are fundamentally social creatures. We've always lived in groups and worked together. It is essential for the survival of a human being to interact and live with fellow humans. It is also key to understand that, introvertism is not really a synonym of isolationist behaviour. Introverts are just people who socialize less in comparision to the rest of the populus, and find the process of connecting with others slightly more challenging than others. That in no way means that introverts can survive without any sort of social contact with other people. 

It is true that society does take a center stage in the human life. I can agree with this, as my fundamental worry, regarding the judgement of other humans and the need for validation from other humans, does tie into this importance given by a human towards society. 

One might say that with the advent of technology, humans are becoming more isolated, but that is not the case. The social interactions of our race have just taken a new form. It has moved from office water coolers and school grounds, into various chatrooms and mailing lists. In a way, humans are as social as before, maybe even more. It is just that the face-to-face physical interaction has dwindled, with each generation.

This is actually easy to prove. Imagine that you need to contact a person. Ask yourself how you'd contact this person. Though people of all ages have access to the same smartphone, younger people would prefer to text and older people would prefer to call. That itself shows a great divide between people who grew up with and without this groundbreaking interconnectivity in the palm of their hands.

So we can say that though introverts (like myself) are hesitant, anxious, uncomfortable to interact with new people, that is not a sign that introverts do not need social contact, or that they are actively trying to isolate themselves from any social contact.

## **What is Convenience?**
We have discussed the ease of communicating with people after the advent of the internet. The ease or convenience of talking to people online, is not only a physical ease (i.e. you can sit at home and communicate with people all around the world) but also a mental and social ease. This is because talking to people online, especially on a chat, is a much lower stakes social task than in person communication. 

The chat interface allows for greater control over how you can seem to the other person, by allowing you to perfectly craft each conversational exchange. The mind is also much more at ease when the actual face and voice of the person is abstracted away behind this chat interface, and you only read the intended communication of the person. This leads to a reduction in social anxiety, because ultimately, interacting with the text representing the thoughts of a person, is much easier than talking to the actual person.

The convenience is not only present when you need to interact with other people, but also in places where social interaction happens as a means of achieving some other objective. Take for example a person going out to get some groceries. That might involve at least a small interaction with the shopkeeper. It might be an opportunity for more social interaction if it's a regular route through your neighbourhood where you interact with other people you know.

But this type of exchange has also been abstracted away in the name of convenience. Quick commerce platforms, Online shopping sites and even food ordering apps bring to our doors whatever we need, from the most trivial things to the most important ones. Ultimately, the realisation slowly begins to dawn that most modern "convenient" solutions move towards the direction of reducing or removing in-person social interactions.
<br><br>



## **Geographical aspect (Cities v Smaller towns and villages)**

Increased convenience is not the only reason though. There is a marked difference between urban and rural communities.

I have to admit this analysis is coming from my biased experience. I have always lived in a city. So I can only imagine or make an educated guess that the physical social interaction in a smaller town or village might be more frequent and carry less anxiety for an introvert.

This stems from the logic that since the number of people are less, and you have interacted with them enough times, it makes it easier. Essentially, you'd see far fewer strangers in a village than a city in a day. But since I do not have lived experience regarding this, feel free to correct me or give me more insight through my mailbox. Your thoughts are always welcome.

## **Individual v Collective**
There's also an increase in individualistic behaviour. It's not really a fault of the technological revolution though. This is more attributable to the current capitalist society and their promises of a meritocracy. Everyone views each other as their competition. This is especially more prevalent in the student / younger working professional populations. 

This leads to a complete destruction of human communities where people are interdependent on each other and work together towards common objectives. The modern human has just become a function that maximizes their money/assets. It is easy to criticize this and call them selfish, but that would be too naive. 

We have to realize that life, and especially intelligent life, always performs actions that successfully predicts it's existence into the future. If there is a path offering a better chance for continued survival, then the human organism by default moves towards that. It's just a shame that money has become one of those factors that increases your chances of living in today's society.
<br><br>



## **Conclusion**
So these are the three themes (Convenience, Geography, Individualism) that I have identified that are reducing in person human interaction and causing increase in general social anxiety in my life. (and maybe in most of your lives as well)

At the end, I can only accept this reality. But that does not mean this cannot be improved upon. I think social interaction is like a muscle which needs to be exercised. So for starters, maybe I'll say one more word than I usually do, try to talk to one person that I wouldn't normally do, and go to one social gathering that I would normally say no to. Let's see if this works out.
