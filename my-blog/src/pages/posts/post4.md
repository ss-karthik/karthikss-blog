## **The Struggle**
If you are a frequent reader of my very empty blog, you would realise that I actively seek out better alternatives to the various tech and tools that we have gotten used to under the veil of Convenience. And if this is your first time on my blog, now you know.
What I conveniently(hehe) forgot to mention is that I always face a struggle while taking such decisions, and generally, never stick to them 100%. I keep going back and forth between the convenient industry standard that everyone uses and the tool/solution that is supposed to be better and more ideal, than it.
<br><br>
I see this tug of war happen constantly in my mind. A recent example that prompted the realisation that then prompted this post, is my usage of spotify. I had a lot of criticisms regarding that platform.
<a href="https://karthikss.netlify.app/posts/post2/">(For Reference, click here)</a> I was happy for a while, using youtube, until that stopped working as well for some reason. Then I went even more extreme and started downloading mp3s and listening to music locally. Sometime later, I cannot pinpoint exactly when, I started going back to spotify. Maybe it was just one new song that I discovered and wanted to hear, before going home and downloading, and this soon turned out to be me using the platform extensively. Back into the trap of comfort and convenience I fell.
<br><br>

## **Is It Correct?**
So now, a new doubt has arisen and I do not have an answer for this one. Still, it is interesting enough to warrant a discussion. If an alternative solution is truly better than the standard that everyone uses, shouldn't it be convenient as well? Technically it should, but the problem is that it is very hard to bring about change at an industrial level. I might be able to continue with my solution to get away from these music platforms or any other proprietary software, but it is near impossible for a single individual to change everyone's mind about the software that we use.
<br><br>
What is scary to me, is that we have accepted this digital convenience so easily in the form of so called free services that we pay for through our data, that at this point, it is hard for us to justify them as not the right thing to be done. It should have never come to a point, where we as a species are so addicted to this digital convenience that even if we try to do the right thing and find alternative ways to live our digital lives, we always fall back into the trap. And this was especially shocking when I realised I myself was doing this see-saw act between the two constantly.
<br><br>

## **Final Thoughts**
I used to criticize proprietary software and platforms that take your data and sell you ads. I used to and still do strongly promote the use of Open Source software and platforms, but I am slowly realising that maybe I was naive. It is not as easy as it seems. It takes a conscious effort to switch and keep going, in a new way of carrying out your digital life. It is almost like breaking a life long habit that does not have any immediate indications that it is a bad one. It is hard for me and hard for everyone who does try. But I still urge everyone, as I do myself, to try and pick up the pieces and keep going on. I hope something crazy happens and a huge digital revolution starts against this, but until then, the more realistic approach is this slow and steady revolution of trying to change, falling back to the old ways and trying again. We may fall back into the old patterns, but the moment we fail, is the moment we stop trying to break those patterns. Wow I sound very philosophical lol.

As always don't take me too seriously. I am an over opinionated idiot. Thanks for reading.
