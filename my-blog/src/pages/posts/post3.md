# ***-> Files***
A file is one of the earliest concepts of storing data on a computer system permanently. You can think of a file as a sort of digital container on your hard disk or SSD, that holds some data. This data can be read and modified as per your request. 

In the beginning, files would have stored data in simple plain text format and would contain only ASCII characters. The files could be directly opened and understood by humans. Some examples would be plain text files(.txt), C programs(.c), etc. But what do these extensions indicate? Clearly there is some sort of a differentiation between the various types of files.

# ***-> File Formats***
With increase in computing power and programming capabilities, there was an advent of specialized software designed for specific tasks. Data needed to be much more complex than just some plain text. Through this, various types of data were being encoded and stored in a file. This is where the concept of file formats slowly originates.

File formats are standardized methods for encoding and storing digital information, allowing computers to recognize and process different types of data. They are identified by unique file extensions that indicate the type of content and the software used to create or open them.

# ***-> Proprietary vs Open File Formats***

There is also another distinction within the file formats. This is based on the method used to encode and store data in a particular file format, and whether that knowledge is open to the public, or held behind closed doors by an organization.

Proprietary file formats are privately owned and controlled by a specific company or organization. They are hidden as patents or trade secrets and generally require specialized software to view and edit.

Open file formats on the other hand are publicly accessible and can be used by anyone. There specifications are made public and any software application can be developed to work with these file formats.

# ***My Experience***
Okay, now that I have laid out some explanation of the terms, let us get into what prompted me to think and write this blog. I am currently pursuing my Computer Science degree and as a requirement in most of the courses, I am supposed to give a presentation on a topic of the course I am taking. I am pretty sure most people have had a similar academic requirement.

Through this process, I have noticed a lot of times, the default file format that everyone uses is PPT or PPTX. But that does not mean it is the best file format. It is just that Microsoft PowerPoint has become such an irreplaceable tool, that all kinds of slide decks are made primarily using PowerPoint.

This especially bugged me, since as a linux user, I have had the experience many times, of PowerPoint presentations not opening properly on Free and Open source Office suites, not being formatted properly etc. (And yes, I am not talking just about the fonts. I am aware that they can be installed.)

Then when I thought to myself, there are open source file formats for word documents, presentations etc. such as ".odf" or ".odp" etc. that work just fine across all types of office suites, both open source ones such as LibreOffice and proprietary ones such as Microsoft Office. Moreover, I have noticed a pattern where once I am done preparing a slide deck, I usually export it to a PDF file (.pdf) in order to make my life easier, since it does not even require specialized software such as an office suite to open.

So it is clear that the usage of PPTX format is not exactly because it is the best, and most consistent across all devices, but is just a side-effect of the popularity or the monopoly of Microsoft PowerPoint.

# ***Why Open File Formats Matter?***
So we have established why most people use PPTX format to create their presentations in. As a side effect of this, most presentation related tools, online slide creation websites and AI tools provide an option to export to the PPTX format.

But I believe people should move away from proprietary file formats such as this, and towards open formats. This is because formats such as DOCX or PPTX are owned by companies like Microsoft. You are basically storing **your data** in a proprietary file format. So it will look as intended on the proprietary softwares, but is not exactly going to be consistent across all devices and softwares. And who knows? In a few years time, they may ask you to pay, just so that you can view your own data, as some proprietary file formats can only be viewed by the specific proprietary softwares.

What is the solution to this then? I am slowly moving towards open file formats (such as .ODF) and when consistency and platform independence matters, I always prefer PDFs. Sure, they are not editable once exported, but this comes with the advantage of "what you see is what you get!". No matter what device you open your .pdf file on, it will be the same. Besides, tools like OpenOffice Draw do exist, if you really want to edit your PDFs.

And since it is an open format, not owned by any specific entity, you can rest assured that all kinds of softwares will be able to display and edit your files well into the future, and no company can lock you out of your own files.
